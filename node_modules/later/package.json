It supports a very flexible schedule definition including support for composite schedules and schedule exceptions. Create new schedules manually, via Cron expression, via text expressions, or using a fully chainable API.\n\nTypes of schedules supported by _Later_:\n\n* Run a report on the last day of every month at 12 AM except in December\n* Install patches on the 2nd Tuesday of every month at 4 AM\n* Gather CPU metrics every 10 mins Mon - Fri and every 30 mins Sat - Sun\n* Send out a scary e-mail at 13:13:13 every Friday the 13th\n\n####For complete documentation visit [http://bunkat.github.io/later/](http://bunkat.github.io/later/).\n\n\n## Installation\nUsing npm:\n\n    $ npm install later\n\nUsing bower:\n\n    $ bower install later\n\n## Building\n\nTo build the minified javascript files for _later_, run `npm install` to install dependencies and then:\n\n    $ make build\n\n## Running tests\n\nTo run the tests for _later_, run `npm install` to install dependencies and then:\n\n    $ make test\n\n## Versioning\n\nReleases will be numbered with the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\n\n* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)\n* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)\n* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch\n\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit [http://semver.org/](http://semver.org/).\n\n## Bug tracker\n\nHave a bug or a feature request? [Please open a new issue](https://github.com/bunkat/later/issues).\n\n## Change Log\n\n### Later v1.1.3\n\n* Merge consecutive ranges when using composite schedules (fixes issues #27)\n\n### Later v1.1.1 and v1.1.2\n\n* Fixed handling of ranged schedules which never go invalid. End date is undefined for these types of schedules.\n\n### Later v1.1.0\n\n* Implemented fullDate (fd) constraint to specify a specific occurrence (or exception)\n    - `later.parse.recur().on(new Date(2013,3,21,10,30,0)).fullDate()`\n\n### Later v1.0.0\n\n* Refactored core engine so that it could be better tested\n    - Added over 41,500 tests and fixed hundreds of edge cases that were unfortunately broken in v0.0.20\n* Core engine is now extensible via custom time periods and custom modifiers\n    - Full examples included in the documentation\n* Added support for finding valid ranges as well as valid instances of schedules\n    - _Later_ can now be used to schedule activities and meetings as well as point in time occurrences\n* Improved support for finding past ranges and instances\n    - Searching forward or backward now produces the same valid occurrences\n* No more need to specify a resolution!\n    - _Later_ now automatically handles this internally, you no longer need to specify your desired resolution. 'Every 5 minutes' now does exactly what you would expect it to :)\n* Changing between UTC and local time has changed.\n    - Use `later.date.UTC()` and `later.date.localTime()` to switch between the two.\n* API for parsers has changed.\n    - Recur is now at `later.parse.recur()`\n    - Cron is now at `later.parse.cron(expr)`\n    - Text is now at `later.parse.text(expr)`\n* API for calculating occurrences has changed.\n    - Schedules are now compiled using `later.schedule(schedule)`\n    - getNext is now `later.schedule(schedule).next(count, start, end)`\n    - getPrev is now `later.schedule(schedule).prev(count, start, end)`\n* `After` meaning 'don't start until after this amount of time' has been deprecated.\n    - This was a hack since people had a hard time with resolutions. With resolutions gone, this is no longer needed and is deprecated since it produced non-deterministic schedules.\n\n**Note:** Schedule definitions did not change (unless you were using `after` constraints which have been deprecated). If you stored any schedule definitions from v0.0.20, they should continue to work unchanged in v1.0.0.",
